# Sprout Scout — Todo Plan

## ✅ 1. Remove "show all, scan on click" mode — DONE

- `search.ts`: removed `Mode` type, `mode` signal, `toggleMode`, `loadMode`, `runOnDemand`, `scanDone`. Search now always opens the SSE stream.
- `search.html`: removed `.mode-row` (toggle button + hint).
- `search.scss`: removed `.mode-row`, `.mode-toggle`, `.mode-hint` styles.
- `services/restaurant.ts`: removed `getRestaurants` and `getVeganDishes` (no callers left). Removed `HttpClient` import. Backend `GET /api/restaurants/{id}/vegan` route still exists — flagged for removal in step 7 if no other consumer surfaces.

## ✅ 2 + 3. Simplify the restaurant card — DONE

- Card now shows: **name, "Vegan options found" badge, address, phone, single primary-link button**.
- Dropped from card: dish list, confidence scores, matched keywords, source URL, fallback-links block, OSM `diet:vegan` hint, expand/collapse chevron, on-demand scan path.
- Primary link priority: `delivery_link.url` (e.g. foodora) → `restaurant.website` → Google Maps search built from name + address.
- Phone row hidden when empty (Overpass returns `phone` from `phone` or `contact:phone`).
- `services/restaurant.ts`: pruned `VeganDish` and `FallbackLink` interfaces; `ScanResult` reduced to `{ restaurant_id, delivery_link? }` since nothing else is consumed by the UI.
- `RestaurantCard` simplified to a presentational component with no scanning logic.

Build passes (`ng build --configuration development`).

## ✅ 4. Bruderundschwester not appearing — DONE

Root cause: tagged `amenity=cafe` in OSM, but the Overpass query only matched `amenity=restaurant`. Discovery was filtering it out before the scanner ever saw it.

- `services/overpass.py`: query now matches `restaurant|cafe|fast_food|pub|bar|biergarten|food_court|ice_cream` via a regex on `amenity`. Also propagates the `amenity` field on each restaurant payload.
- Verified: postcode 2340 went from 29 to 57 results; Bruder und Schwester (`node/1925290287`) now comes back with `website=http://www.bruderundschwester.com`.
- The homepage doesn't contain vegan keywords directly, but the one-hop crawl from #6 follows `/speisekarte` and the PDF adapter pulls 7 vegan dishes.

## ✅ 6. kennys.at — DONE

Root cause: menu lives one click deep at `/produkte/` (and sub-pages); homepage's only "vegan" mentions are inside image filenames, which BeautifulSoup strips during text extraction.

- `services/adapters/generic.py`: added `find_menu_links()` — same-host `<a>` candidates whose path or link text matches `menu|menü|menue|speisekarte|karte|produkte|gerichte|essen|food|drinks|getränke`, capped at 4.
- `services/scanner.py`: `_dispatch` now uses the post-redirect URL as the base (`response.url`), and falls through to `_crawl_menu_links` only when both pdf and generic scans on the homepage return empty. Each candidate is run through both adapters.
- Verified: `https://kennys.at/` now yields 8 vegan dishes via `/produkte/` and sub-pages. Same fix also rescues `bruderundschwester.com` from #4 (homepage → `/speisekarte` PDF → 7 dishes).

## ✅ 8. Lift the 30-restaurant scan cap — DONE

Full-zip scan now in effect. Defensive ceiling of 500 (no realistic Austrian zip approaches this); for zips above that the existing `capped` flag still surfaces correctly in the `start` event.

- `routers/restaurants.py`: `SCAN_RESTAURANT_CAP` raised to 500. New `SSE_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL = 15`.
- Replaced the `asyncio.as_completed` consumer with `asyncio.wait(timeout=SSE_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL, return_when=FIRST_COMPLETED)` in a loop. When 15s elapse with no scan completing, the stream emits `:keepalive\n\n` (an SSE comment — browsers ignore, but proxies see traffic and don't drop the connection). Disconnect check still runs every iteration. Cleanup cancels remaining `pending` tasks on exit.
- `components/search/search.html`: when `p.total > 50` and not capped, shows a "large area — this may take a few minutes" hint next to the spinner so the user expects a multi-minute scan.
- README: SSE section updated (ceiling + keepalive note).

Build passes (`ng build --configuration development`). Backend module imports cleanly with the new constants.

## ✅ 9. Amenity filter dropdown — DONE

Native `<select>` (no Material dep). Backend-side filtering, so fewer scans / fewer outbound HTTP calls when an amenity is selected.

- `services/overpass.py`: `FOOD_AMENITIES` constant unchanged (the Overpass query still pulls all eight in one call so the cache stays useful across filter switches).
- `routers/restaurants.py`: extracted `_validate_query`, `_load_restaurants`, `_filter_by_amenity` helpers. Both `GET /api/restaurants` and `GET /api/restaurants/scan` accept `amenity=<value>` (validated against `FOOD_AMENITIES`, 400 on unknown). Cache key stays zip-only — switching the dropdown is a cache hit + cheap in-memory filter, so no extra Overpass calls.
- `services/restaurant.ts`: `scanStream(zip, amenity?)` builds the URL with `URLSearchParams`.
- `components/search/search.ts`: `AMENITY_OPTIONS` const + `selectedAmenity` field passed to the stream.
- `components/search/search.html` + `search.scss`: native `<select class="amenity-select">` between zip input and country select; styled the enabled variant.

Build passes (`ng build --configuration development`).

## ✅ 12. Soft-natural UI redesign — DONE

Reframed the editorial-magazine look into a calmer "field guide" aesthetic. Controls became more obviously interactive; brand accent shifted from yellow-chartreuse to soft leaf-green.

- `styles.scss`: brand accent vars repurposed — `--chartreuse` (#E8F564 yellow → #C8E0BA soft leaf), `--chartreuse-d` (#C8D844 → #9FBE89). New `--leaf`, `--leaf-d` aliases. New soft-shadow tokens (`--shadow-soft`, `--shadow-medium`, `--shadow-cta`, `--shadow-cta-h`). Global `@keyframes cta-spin` lives here so it's not subject to component-scoped CSS quirks; `prefers-reduced-motion` block carries an explicit override for `.cta-spinner` so essential feedback keeps rotating.
- `search.scss`: control surface became a rounded paper panel (1px sage border, 14px radius, soft drop shadow). Tabs are a pill-shaped segmented control. Form controls are 54px with bordered fields, focus snaps the border to moss + a 4px sage-soft halo (no more yellow ring). Radius pills are real selectable buttons (forest fill + sage rings/unit on active). CTA is 54px with weight 600 sans label, soft drop shadow that deepens on hover, and an `is-stop` variant that paints rust during an in-flight scan.
- `field-select.{ts,html,scss}`: new custom dropdown component — sage-bordered trigger that matches the field style, rounded paper panel with soft shadow. Open-direction is computed from the trigger's `getBoundingClientRect` (flips upward when there's ≤336px below and more space above). `:host` is permanently `z-index: 50` so the panel always paints over later siblings.
- `restaurant-card.{html,scss}`: `Nº 01` prefix removed. Cards became standalone surfaces — paper bg, 1px sage border, 12px radius, soft drop shadow, 14px gap between cards. Hover lifts 1px and darkens the border.
- Typography unified — every interactive control uses Albert Sans (weight 500 default, 600 active/selected). Fraunces display is reserved for hero, results count, scan progress numerals, restaurant card name, and the small italic accents in scan caption / error notice / footer / brand wordmark. `Nº 01 · The Field Guide` eyebrow + `Vol. I · Vienna · AT` brand-meta nav both removed.
- Loading spinner replaces the trailing arrow on the CTA during locate / scan (zip + radius forms).

## ✅ 13. Paginated results — DONE

Page size 10 (only paginates when more results come in). `currentPage` signal + `pagedItems` / `totalPages` / `pageNumbers` computed signals in `search.ts`. Smart ellipsis kicks in past 7 pages: `[1, …, current-1, current, current+1, …, total]`. New search resets the page to 1 inside `startStream`. `setPage` smooth-scrolls back to the top of the results section. Styles live in `search.scss` (`.pagination`, `.page-btn`, `.page-arrow`, `.page-ellipsis`) — sage-bordered paper buttons, forest-fill on active, hairline divider above.

## ✅ 14. Stop control + Overpass resilience — DONE

Stop is purely frontend: `Search.stop()` calls `streamSub.unsubscribe()`, which triggers the `EventSource.close()` teardown in `RestaurantService.streamFrom`. Backend's existing `request.is_disconnected()` polling in `_stream_scan` then cancels in-flight scan tasks via the `finally` block. Already-found results stay visible. CTA flips to rust `is-stop` variant during `loading()`; locating remains disabled-with-spinner because `getCurrentPosition` has no clean abort.

Overpass resilience:
- `services/overpass.py`: `_run_query` retries up to 3 attempts with 1s/2s backoff on `429 | 502 | 503 | 504` and `httpx.RequestError`. Permanent 4xx (excluding 429) raises immediately.
- `routers/restaurants.py`: `_load_restaurants` and `_load_restaurants_by_radius` wrap the `fetch_*` calls in `try/except (httpx.HTTPStatusError, httpx.RequestError)` and convert to `HTTPException(503, "The restaurant directory is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a moment.")`.
- `services/restaurant.ts` `streamFrom`: tracks whether any SSE event was received. If `EventSource` reaches `CLOSED` without any data (i.e. the initial GET failed with non-2xx), calls `subscriber.error()` instead of silently completing. Previously the spinner spun forever on a 500/503.
- `search.ts`: error handler message updated to "Could not start the search. The directory service is temporarily unavailable — please try again in a moment."

## ✅ 11. Radius search ("Near me" mode) — DONE

Two-mode search via segmented control: existing `By zip` plus new `Near me` (500m / 1km / 2km, default 500m). Backend hard-clips to Austria via the Overpass `area["ISO3166-1"="AT"]` filter; cross-border hits are dropped at the source.

- `services/overpass.py`: extracted `_run_query`. New `fetch_restaurants_by_radius(lat, lon, radius_m)` using `(around:R,lat,lon)(area.country)` against the same eight food amenities.
- `routers/restaurants.py`: new `_validate_radius_query` and `_load_restaurants_by_radius` (cache key `AT_radius_{round(lat,3)}_{round(lon,3)}_{radius}` ≈ 100m grid). Two new endpoints: `GET /api/restaurants-by-radius` and `GET /api/restaurants/scan-by-radius`. Refactored streaming/keepalive/cancellation logic into `_stream_scan` reused by both SSE endpoints.
- `services/restaurant.ts`: extracted `streamFrom(url)` helper. New `scanStreamByRadius(lat, lon, radius, amenity?)`.
- `components/search/search.ts`: `mode`, `radius`, `coords`, `geoStatus` signals. `searchByRadius()` is async and calls `getFreshCoords()` (Promise wrapper around `getCurrentPosition`, `maximumAge: 60000`) on every press — denial or unavailable → snap to zip + inline error. No standalone refresh/locate button; the Search button is the single entry point. `tryLargerRadius()` powers the empty-state suggestion.
- `components/search/search.html` + `.scss`: segmented control (`By zip` / `Near me`), radius pill group, "Try N km" suggest button on empty radius result. While locating, the Search button shows an inline white spinner (`.spinner-on-dark`) + `Locating…` label.

Build passes (`ng build --configuration development`). Backend module imports cleanly.

## 🔒 Pre-launch security hardening

Audit done 2026-05-08 against the deployed-but-unreleased state of `main`. Items are ordered by severity. **#15 is a launch blocker** — public, anonymous SSRF into Render's metadata endpoint and internal services.

## ✅ 15. Block SSRF in the scanner — DONE

New helper `backend/services/safe_fetch.py` validates every outbound URL before fetching:

- `is_safe_url(url)` rejects non-http(s) schemes, missing hosts, IP-literal URLs that resolve to private space, and DNS hostnames whose `getaddrinfo` returns *any* address that is `is_private | is_loopback | is_link_local | is_reserved | is_multicast | is_unspecified` (or unparseable).
- `safe_get` / `safe_head` walk redirects manually (`MAX_REDIRECTS = 5`) and re-validate each `Location` hop before the next request.

Wired into:
- `services/scanner.py`: `httpx.AsyncClient` switched to `follow_redirects=False`. Initial homepage fetch and every menu-link crawl candidate go through `safe_get`.
- `services/adapters/pdf.py`: `_fetch_pdf` uses `safe_head` + `safe_get` for every PDF candidate, including ones unwrapped from `?file=`/`?url=`/`?src=` viewer params.

End-to-end verified — `scan_restaurant` returns the no-menu fallback with no fetch issued for `http://169.254.169.254/...`, `http://127.0.0.1/...`, `http://10.0.0.1/...`. Integration test (`tests.scan_examples`) still produces the five expected outcomes (Zen → delivery link, Akakiko → 2 dishes, Ofenbarung + MisterBeans → no_menu, Bruder → 7 dishes from PDF).

Residual risk: DNS-rebinding window between `_resolve_safe` and the actual `client.get` is open. Mitigation would be IP-literal pinning with explicit `Host` header — deferred since the current attack model (OSM-edited URLs, attacker-controlled redirects) is fully covered by the resolve-then-fetch check.

## ✅ 16. Delete `GET /api/restaurants/{id}/vegan` — DONE

`git grep` confirmed zero callers. Removed the `@router.get("/restaurants/{restaurant_id}/vegan")` handler in `backend/routers/restaurants.py`. The `scan_restaurant` import stays — still used by `_stream_scan` and `tests.scan_examples`.

Routes after the change: `/api/restaurants`, `/api/restaurants-by-radius`, `/api/restaurants/scan`, `/api/restaurants/scan-by-radius`, `/health`. The unused `RestaurantCard.index` input still pending — folded into #10 cleanup.

## ✅ 17. Move frontend `apiUrl` into Angular environment files — DONE

Standard Angular environment pattern in place. Production bundle no longer leaks `localhost:8000` (verified by `grep`).

- New `frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` — `{ production: false, apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8000/api' }`.
- New `frontend/src/environments/environment.production.ts` — `{ production: true, apiUrl: 'https://api.sprout-scout.at/api' }`. Subdomain split (frontend on `www.sprout-scout.at` via Vercel, backend on `api.sprout-scout.at` via Render with a CNAME). Reason for not collapsing onto a single Vercel-rewrite origin: SSE streams need unbuffered transport, and an extra Vercel proxy hop in front of the live scan stream is asking for buffering / connection-drop trouble.
- `angular.json`: production configuration gained a `fileReplacements` entry swapping `environment.ts` for `environment.production.ts`. Also bumped the `anyComponentStyle` budget from 4kB warn / 8kB error to 12kB warn / 20kB error — pre-existing issue, `search.scss` had grown to 12kB over successive redesigns and was blocking the prod build entirely.
- `services/restaurant.ts`: hardcoded literal replaced with `private apiUrl = environment.apiUrl;` (import from `'../../environments/environment'`).
- Deploy note: when the Render service is created, point its custom-domain field at `api.sprout-scout.at` and add the matching CNAME in your DNS. If you change the API host, only `environment.production.ts` needs a one-line edit.

Dev build: 1.65 MB (unoptimized). Prod build: 310 kB raw / 80 kB gzipped main bundle, zero `localhost` strings in the output.

## ✅ 18. Tighten CORS — DONE

CORS is now env-driven so the production origin list lives on Render rather than baked into the image.

- `backend/main.py`: reads `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated). Defaults to `http://localhost:4200` for dev so a fresh checkout works without env config. `allow_methods=["GET"]` — every public route is GET-only. `allow_headers=["*"]` is fine since `allow_credentials` stays at its default (`False`); no cookies, no auth, no preflight surface to widen.
- Production env var on Render (documented in README *Backend → Render*): `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://www.sprout-scout.at,https://sprout-scout.at`. Append `,https://<user>.codeberg.page` while DNS is propagating if you want to smoke-test the default Codeberg URL.
- Verified: backend imports cleanly with the default origin list, env var parsing trims whitespace and drops empty entries, integration regression (`tests.scan_examples`) still produces the five expected outcomes.

## ✅ 19. Replace cache-key sanitization with a hash — DONE

`backend/services/cache.py` — `_cache_path` now returns `CACHE_DIR / f"{sha256(key)}.json"`. Path traversal via key contents is impossible by construction; the only thing the function can ever produce is a 64-hex-char filename inside `CACHE_DIR`. Existing `.cache/` files keyed by the old sanitizer become orphans on first run after deploy — harmless (1-week TTL would have expired them anyway, and on Render the disk is ephemeral so the cache rebuilds on every cold start). Locally you can `rm -rf backend/.cache/` if you want a clean slate. Integration test still produces all five expected outcomes.

## ✅ 21 + 22 + 23. Legal pages (Impressum, OSM attribution, Privacy) — DONE

Audit-driven legal triple shipped via a single non-disruptive modal pattern. The search flow is untouched — no router, no URL state, no surface changes to the existing controls.

- New `LegalModal` component (`frontend/src/app/components/legal-modal/`) — single component, `kind: 'impressum' | 'privacy'` input, emits `closed`. Backdrop click + Esc + close button. Sage-bordered paper panel, soft drop shadow, scrollable body with `max-height: calc(100vh - 48px)` so short viewports don't trap content.
- `App` (`app.ts`) gained a `legalOpen = signal<LegalKind | null>(null)` plus `openLegal` / `closeLegal`. Modal renders only when open.
- `app.html` footer redesigned into a right-aligned `.foot-text` column with three lines:
  1. existing tagline (`A field guide to vegan menus · {{ year }}.`),
  2. **OSM attribution** — `Restaurant data © OpenStreetMap contributors.` with the required link to `openstreetmap.org/copyright` (ODbL § 4.3),
  3. footer nav with `Impressum · Privacy` buttons that open the modal.
- **Impressum content** — Information gemäß § 5 ECG / § 25 MedienG: Valentin Röcklinger, K. Elisabethstrasse 13, 2340 Mödling, Austria, heislsheimen@gmail.com. Marked as non-commercial hobby project (no Firmenbuch/UID).
- **Privacy content** — GDPR Art. 13 notice: search terms / IP / geolocation / cached scan results, processors (Render, Vercel, Google Fonts, OSM/Overpass), GDPR Art. 15–21 rights with Datenschutzbehörde complaint link, contact email.
- `search.html` + `.scss` — radius-mode now shows a small inline `geo-note` directly under the tabs: *"Your location is sent to find nearby restaurants. We don't store it."* So the user reads the consent statement before they hit Search.
- `README.md` Design Decisions section — new "Data attribution" bullet documenting the ODbL license and its § 4.3 attribution requirement.

Build passes (`ng build --configuration development`).

## ✅ 20. counter.dev real ID — DONE

`frontend/src/index.html` — placeholder `YOUR-COUNTER-DEV-ID` replaced with the real counter.dev site ID `ca079955-cd3a-4c77-8c03-778fc417f597`. Analytics now actually tracks.

Still open as a follow-up if desired (deferred — separate from launch blockers):
- **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** counter.dev publishes a versioned bundle, so pinning a `sha384-…` hash means the script breaks on every bundle update; the practical hardening here is to self-host a copy of `script.js` (then SRI-pin it) or accept the small supply-chain risk in exchange for live updates. No action taken — counter.dev is a small, EU-leaning analytics service, and the script runs inert unless `data-id` matches.
- **Content-Security-Policy:** worth adding before launch as a `<meta http-equiv>` tag in `index.html`. Starting policy: `default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; script-src 'self' https://cdn.counter.dev; connect-src 'self' https://api.sprout-scout.at;`. Test carefully — Angular's runtime emits inline styles and may need `'unsafe-inline'` on `style-src`. Deferred.

---

## ✅ 10. Cleanup pass — DONE

- `RestaurantCard.index` input + `prefix` getter deleted from `restaurant-card.ts`. Dead since #12 removed the `Nº 01 ·` prefix display from the card template.
- `Restaurant` interface (`services/restaurant.ts`) trimmed: `osm_diet_vegan` and `osm_type` removed. Both were declared but never read anywhere in the UI — backend still emits `osm_type` inside `no_menu_payload` but that payload is filtered out server-side (`_stream_scan` only yields restaurants with `dishes`), so the field never crosses the wire.
- `GET /api/restaurants/{id}/vegan` was already removed in #16. No stragglers.
- **Backend extractor/adapter dedup — examined, no action.** Each adapter (`generic.py`, `pdf.py`) does format-specific normalization (HTML script-stripping + `get_text("\n")` for HTML; `pdfplumber.extract_text()` page-joining for PDF) and then hands off to the shared `extract_vegan_dishes(text, source)`. That's the right separation, not duplication.
- Integration test (`tests.scan_examples`) passes: Zen → delivery, Akakiko → 2 dishes, Ofenbarung + MisterBeans → no_menu, Bruder → 7 PDF dishes.

## 🔭 v2 backlog (post-launch)

Things deferred until after the v1 public launch. Pick up when there's a reason to.

### v2.1 — OCR fallback for image-only PDFs (was #5)

**Target case:** `zuminderhof.at` ships a scanned PDF menu — `pdfplumber.extract_text()` returns empty, so the scanner currently surfaces it as `no_menu` even though the word *vegan* is visible on the page.

**Why deferred:** adds Tesseract + Poppler as system dependencies, which means writing a `Dockerfile` for Render instead of using the simple Python web service template. Worth it once we know v1 traffic justifies the deploy complexity, or once a second image-only PDF surfaces.

**Plan when picked up:**
- `backend/services/adapters/pdf.py` — after `pdfplumber.extract_text()`, check whether the result is empty (or below a small whitespace threshold, e.g. <20 non-whitespace chars across all pages). **OCR runs *only* if normal extraction is empty** — if extraction yields text but no vegan keyword matches, *don't* OCR. Keeps the common path fast.
- If empty → fall through to OCR: rasterize each page with `pdf2image`, run `pytesseract.image_to_string`, concatenate.
- New pip deps: `pytesseract`, `pdf2image`. System deps: Tesseract binary, Poppler. Document in `backend/requirements.txt` + a "System dependencies" section in README. Render deploy switches from buildpack to `Dockerfile`.
- Per-PDF OCR timeout cap (e.g. 15s) so a 50-page scanned menu doesn't blow the 25s scan timeout for the whole restaurant.
- Verify against `zuminderhof.at`: download the PDF, confirm `extract_text()` returns empty, confirm OCR finds "vegan".
